## Quarto essentials

This project is written in Quarto. So we need some Quarto basics to get started..

### Create a Quarto project

To create a quarto project from an exsisting directory, run from terminal `$ quarto create project`, use arrow to select the type of the project, and then set the directory to current directory `./`.

After creating the quator project, we can set the title and author of the project in `_qarto.yml` file. Chapters are also arranged in this file.

A quarto project must have an `index.qmd` file, which does not show up as a chapter in a book project. It is often used as preface.

### Work with a quarto project

-   **Preview in web browser** with `$ quarto preview`.
-   **Render for publication** with `$ quarto render`
